# 🚀 RTLTOHELLOWORD

## 📘 Description

**RTLTOHELLOWORD** is a hands-on project that demonstrates the complete flow of bringing up an open-source **RISC-V processor core** from **RTL (Register Transfer Level)** all the way to executing a **"Hello, World"** program on a simulated or real hardware console. 

The project walks through the full system bring-up — including RTL setup, toolchain compilation, software stack preparation, and system integration — showcasing the practical process of going from digital design to running bare-metal or minimal OS software.

This project serves as a foundational learning experience for:
- Hardware-software co-design
- Embedded systems development
- Processor bring-up

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- ✅ Set up and configure an open-source RISC-V RTL core (e.g., PicoRV32, CVA6, or Rocket Chip)
- ✅ Build and verify the RTL using simulation tools (e.g., Verilator, ModelSim, or VCS)
- ✅ Install and configure the RISC-V GCC toolchain and build a minimal C runtime
- ✅ Compile a `"Hello, World"` program targeting the core
- ✅ Load and run the program using simulation or an FPGA implementation
- ✅ Print `"Hello, World"` to the console to verify end-to-end flow
